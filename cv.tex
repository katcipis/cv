{
I'm a curious programmer that likes to explore different ways to design, build and test software
always trying to understand as much as I can from the entire environment I'm working in.
That led me to do a lot of different things in my 10 years career, from embedded
software in C to distributed systems in a variety of languages and protocols.
I'm passionate about automation and minimalism when building scalable, efficient and flexible software.

{Florianópolis, Brazil}
{\emph{Software Engineer} \\

I started working on a solution to web audio playback
with very specific audio effects (like silence removal,
change in pitch) that had to be developed using Flash (RTMP).
To solve that problem I worked with
two different open source C++ projects that did reverse
engineering of the RTMP protocol to develop our own
Flash Media Server. I worked directly with the integration
of the server playback logic with Gstreamer and the plugins
that enabled the desired effects on playback. \\

The next project was a solution to biometric identification
using a third party C library that built and scored voice models.
I developed a REST service in Lua that integrated with C code
that built the voice models and used MongoDB to store the
voice models and perform searches on the database. \\

{\emph{Trainee} \\

Helped in the development of an
cross platform (Windows and Linux) audio streaming
library for a VoIP softphone, aiming at porting
the current application that was Windows only to Linux. I also
got involved in the development of a prototype for a voice
biometrics system.

{\emph{Trainee} \\

Worked on adding new features on the system responsible to
integrate medical equipment to the DICOM system, developing a
cross platform domain specific graphical XML editor.
This involved learning C++ and XML parsing, together with
developing cross platform GUI applications, on this case
using WxWidgets. The code has been tested using CppUnit.
