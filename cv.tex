{\emph{Software Developer - Data Platform Team} \\

    As a software developer on the data platform team I started to be
    responsible of a broad context involving multiple teams, building not
    only services but also tooling to be used by those teams.
    Besides the technical challenges of providing a platform I also performed
    code reviews and coaching with across multiple teams.
    There was a lot of challenges like:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Migrating the entire infrastructure of multiple teams from AWS to Azure
    \item Migrate 10 databases (MongoDB, Postgres, ElasticSearch, CockroachDB) to Azure
    \item Provide automated and validated backup for all databases
    \item Specify and implement a new DSL to develop web spiders
    \item Create capture API enabling third party web spiders to integrate on our data pipeline
    \item Scale the ingestion of huge CSV files (terabytes per file)
    \item Define solutions that crossed multiple teams boundaries
    \item Investigate performance problems on services and databases
\end{itemize}

Main accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully automated infrastructure provisioning at Azure
    \item Specified and developed generic backup strategy at Azure
    \item Entire infrastructure access through a bastion host as a security measure
\end{itemize}
}

    \item Maintaining all downloaded raw data at S3
    \item Defining and documenting good protocols for proper service integration
    \item Developing services on different languages, like Go and Python
    \item Migrating the whole data pipeline to a new service oriented architecture
    \item Coach the team on good test techniques for the new architecture
    \item Developed new services to provide good proxies and captcha breaking
\end{itemize}

Besides the technical challenges I also helped the team to apply some
development practices, like TDD (Test Driven Development),code review
and continuous integration.
Together we built a DevOps culture to enable infrastructure as code
on our team, we where responsible for the whole solution, from the development
to testing and deployment (including monitoring the production system).\\

Main accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical leadership and coaching for a team of 6 people

    \item Cluster orchestration at AWS/Azure using Kubernetes, CoreOS and Docker
    \item Migrating all infrastructure from Codero to AWS
    \item Later, migrated the infrastructure from AWS to Azure
    \item Active participation on building the tools to automate infrastructure on Azure
    \item Aided on the migration of more than 100 crawlers to Kubernetes
    \item Actively participated on the screening and interviews of new candidates for the team
    \item Coached new members
    \item Implemented a real time monitoring for the data production pipeline using StatsD and Sysdig
    \item Gave talks inside the company and on events like TDC (The Developers Conference) and GopherCon
